# Heart.disease.prediction

This data came from the University of California Irvine data repository and is used to predict heart disease. It is available in the data.world website. Patients were classified as having or not having heart disease based on cardiac catheterization, the gold standard. If they had more than 50% narrowing of a coronary artery they were labeled as having heart disease. In this cohort there are 270 patients and there are 13 independent predictive variables or column attributes. The attributes are as follows:

•	Age - age of a person in years. Type integer. No missing values. Role feature.
•	Sex – gender of a person. Type categorical. 
1 = male
0 = female. 
No missing values. Role feature.
•	Chest Pain type – type categorical. 
1 = typical angina
2 = atypical angina
3 = non-anginal pain
4 = asymptomatic. 
No missing values. Role feature.
•	BP – resting blood pressure (on admission to the hospital). Type categorical. No missing values. Role feature.
•	Cholesterol – serum cholesterol (mg/dl).  Type integer. No missing values. Role feature.
•	FBS over 120 – fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. Type categorical.
1 = true
0 = false. 
No missing values. Role feature.
•	EKG Results – resting electrocardiographic results. 
0 = normal
1 = having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy). 
Type categorical. No missing values. Role feature.
•	Max HR – maximum heart rate achieved. Type integer. No missing values. Role feature.
•	Exercise angina – exercise induced angina. Type categorical. 
1 = yes
0 = no. 
No missing values. Role feature.
•	ST depression – ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. Type integer. No missing values. Role feature.
•	Slope of ST – the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. Type categorical. 
1 = unsloping
2 = flat
3 = downsloping. 
No missing values. Role feature.
•	Number of vessels fluro – number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flurosopy. Type integer. Yes, missing values. Role feature.
•	Thallium – type categorical. 
3 = normal
6 = fixed defect
7 = reversable defect. 
Role feature
•	Heart Disease – diagnosis of heart disease. Type categorical. 
0 = < 50% diameter narrowing
1 = > 50% diameter narrowing. 
No missing values. Role target.
